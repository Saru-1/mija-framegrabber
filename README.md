# mija-framegrabber

Crappy sample program to grab the video main and substream just like the miio binaries do.

You need the mstar sdk and some libs from the camera to compile it (libshbf, libshbfev, libpthread-2.25, libc-2.25 libev) 

You need to clone the repo to $sdk/MI/sample/ and have the libs in $sdk/lib.
